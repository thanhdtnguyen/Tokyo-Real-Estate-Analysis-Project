# Tokyo-Real-Estate-Analysis-Project 

Tokyo is the capital city and the most populus of Japan. The price of residential areas in Tokyo has an average increase of 2.5% for the past 7 consecutive years. Specifically, Toshima-ku's land price increased by 10.9% compared to 1 year ago. It is the second-highest increase in price among Tokyo's residential areas. _(Reference: https://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/standard-land-prices-tokyo-2019/)_

This project is a part of my undergraduate seminar in data science. In this project, I used the data from the Land General Information System of the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism to analyze the real estate landscape of two wards of Tokyo, Toshima Ward and Suginami Ward.
